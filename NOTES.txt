Viral Inactivation Project
Jan 2021

Some viral infections present a risk to researchers as their infections
particles can be present in samples including tissue and feces. Here we
apply common viral inactivation techniques to DNA extraction method to 
access their effect on the 16s rRNA characterization of the gut microb-
iome.

These methods include:
	1) Control - QIAamp PowerFecal DNA Extraction Kit
	2) SDS - Previously established 4% SDS lysis buffer
	3) Holder Pasteurization - 63°C for 30 min
	4) Buffer AVL - High - guanidinium thianocynate salt
	5) Buffer AVL + Heat - guanininium thianocynate salt + 60° for 
	   15 min.
	6) TRIzol - phenol/guanidinium thianocynate salt
